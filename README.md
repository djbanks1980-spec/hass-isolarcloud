# iSolarCloud integration for HomeAssistant

This integration retrieves data from the [iSolarCloud API](https://developer-api.isolarcloud.com/) provided by Sungrow.

Integration is based on the [pysolarcloud](https://github.com/bugjam/pysolarcloud) library.

## Sensors

The integration will add one device to your HomeAssistant, representing your Sungrow plant. The following sensors are added to the device:

### Energy sensors (in Wh)
* Battery charge energy
* Battery discharge energy
* Consumed energy
* Purchased energy
* Feed-in energy
* Produced energy
* Daily Produced energy
* Direct consumption

The energy sensors can be used in HomeAssistant's [Energy Dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/).

### Battery sensor (in %)
* Battery level

### Power sensors (in W)
* Load power
* Power flow (This is not explained well in the Sungrow documentation. It seems like it is the net power through the inverter, ie. current solar production +/- battery (dis)charge)

### Power Factor sensors (in %)
* Fraction Power (Indicates the ratio between the generated power and the installed power)

It's possible that other plant types offer different data points which may require changes to the integration. The current configuration is based on my own SH8.0RT-V112 plant.

## Configuration

1. Create an account in the [Sungrow Developer Portal](https://developer-api.isolarcloud.com/)
2. Create a new app
3. Enable the "Authorize with OAuth2.0" setting and enter this Redirect URI: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` [^1]
4. Wait for Sungrow to approve your app
5. When the app is approved, you can find the needed configuration details in the developer portal

[^1]: If you have disabled My HomeAssistant, set the Redirect URI to `(your-home-assisant-address)/auth/external/callback`

## Installation

The integration can be installed with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz):

1. Add `https://github.com/bugjam/hass-isolarcloud` as a user defined repository in HACS
2. Install *iSolarCloud* from the HACS store
3. Restart HomeAssistant
4. Install *iSolarCloud* in HomeAssistant: Settings -> Integrations -> Add integration
5. Select your iSolarCloud server
6. The integration uses HomeAssistant's [Application Credentials](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/application_credentials/) integration to manage the OAuth2 configuration. You will be prompted to enter *Client Id* and *Client Secret*
   * *Client Id* must contain two values from the Sungrow developer portal: *ApplicationId* and *Appkey*, separated by a `@`. Example: `499@586FEE69FC005B17361AB992FC5B1CEA`
      NOTE: The *ApplicationID* can be found in the URL when viewing the details of your now-approved Sungrow App in the developer portal.
   * *Client Secret* is the *Secret Key*
7. HomeAssistant will show a button to navigate to iSolarCloud
8. Log in and select the plant you want to fetch data for
9. You will be redirected back to [My Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/my/)

### Upgrade from previous versions

To upgrade from earlier versions of this integration (before v0.5.0), update the Redirct URI in Sungrow Developer Portal to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`. Previous versions used an intermediate server (`bounce.e-dreams.dk`) in the authorisation flow but this is no longer needed. 

### Update interval

After setting up the integration, you can change the update interval under Settings -> Devices & Services -> Integrations -> Sungrow iSolarcloud -> CONFIGURE.

According to Sungrow, the data refreshes about every 5 minutes. They recommend that the interval should not be shorter than 5 minutes (300 seconds).

## Importing historical data

The integration can fetch energy data from iSolarCloud to make statistics available in HomeAssistant, e.g. from before the integration was installed or in case your HomeAssistant has been offline.

Data will be imported in 1-hour intervals. Import is available for data before today's date.

The import can be initiated from [Developer Tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/):

> [!NOTE] 
> Imported data may appear to be 1 hour off in the Energy Dashboard, e.g. the energy consumed between 09:00 and 10:00 appears in the "10:00-11:00" column in the dashboard. This is because HomeAssistant attributes the value for 10:00 to the 10:00-11:00 in the visual presentation, even though the energy was really used in the previous hour. The underlying data is stored correctly, it's just the visualization which is off.
